# No More Antlion Griefing

This terraria mod works by preventing the vanilla kill code to be executed for SandBallFalling projectiles,
as long as projectile.friendly is false. This hopefully will only cause projectiles fired by antlions 
to be affected. When placed by the player and when falling as a result of player action (tested 
mining and bombs). Note that this mod plays the projectile death sound itself, since that doesn't happen
when the vanilla code is skipped.

I have no idea if this will work in multiplayer, but I don't see why it wouldn't.

This is my first mod, so hopefully everything works out.
